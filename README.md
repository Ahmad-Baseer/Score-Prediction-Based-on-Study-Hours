# How to run the application

1. Assuming you have Python installed in your system, after that first you have to run this command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in cmd to install the required libraries.
2. Then you have to run the Prediction_Model file, It will export the prediction model as: ```model.sav```  in your working directory.
3. After having ```model.sav``` you can run ```Web_App.py```, it will create app.py in your working directory.
4. That's all you should have now you have to open cmd in your working directory and run this command: ```streamlit run app.py```, it will run your application locally.
5. Now you can follow any YouTube video to deploy this application.
6. You can use my application here: [Student-Score-Prediction](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AhmadHashim/Student-Score-Prediction) 

# Complete working of this application
## Data Preprocessing
To begin, I printed the head and tail of the dataset to understand its structure and formatting. Next, I obtained a five-number summary using the ```describe``` function, which allowed for a careful examination of the data. Based on these initial insights, the following decisions were made:
1. No additional feature engineering or preprocessing was needed for this dataset. The data is already well-structured, properly distributed, and contains only the two required columns. This picture illustrates all of these insights.

## Prediction Algorithm
So, directly jumping into the prediction algorithm. First, the input (```X```) and output (```y```) variables were defined, representing ```Hours``` and ```Scores```, respectively. The data was then split into training and test sets using the ```train_test_split``` function, with `random_state=0` to ensure consistent distribution across runs.

Since the data contains only two columns â€” one independent and one dependent â€” and shows a clear relationship, linear regression was chosen as the model. Using the ```fit``` function, the model was trained on the training dataset.

Once training was complete, I created the line equation based on the model's weights and intercept to assess how well it fits the data points, as shown in the following image.

## Model Evaluation
The model's accuracy on both the training and test sets was approximately 98%, which is expected given the simplicity and straightforward nature of the datasetâ€”it may simply be capturing basic patterns. Additionally, the mean absolute error was calculated to be around 2.89, indicating that, on average, each predicted score could deviate by this amount.

## Web Application
I built a basic web application using Python's Streamlit framework. The model, previously saved with ```pickle```, is loaded by the app to predict scores based on user input. The predicted score is then returned as a response within the web application.
